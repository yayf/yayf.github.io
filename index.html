<b>About</b> (before it moves to its own page)
</br>
You are your focus is just variant of you are what you eat. Do you eat the same thing everyday for every meal?
No?</br> Well neither do I focus on the same thing every moment of every day. I'm going against the grain and putting out something
that at least I know I would enjoy and I hope you do as well.</br> There will be a wide variety of topics from Bitcoin to Wrestling, 
anime to productivity things, etc. I'm not finding a niche and staying there this is where we get to throw the mud and see what sticks.</br>
I hope for this to be interactive, to fork and merge, and be a fun time for all!
